Data pagination and filtering are techniques used to enhance user experience by managing the display of large datasets on web pages.
Pagination divides content into discrete pages, enabling users to navigate through manageable chunks of data rather than overwhelming them with an entire dataset at once. 
Filtering allows users to refine the displayed data based on specific criteria, making it easier to find relevant information.
Implementing these features with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves creating a dynamic interface where the HTML provides the structure, 
CSS ensures a visually appealing and responsive layout, and JavaScript handles the logic for fetching, displaying, and updating the data based on user interactions.
